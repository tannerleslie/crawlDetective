# crawlDetective

The program simply crawls project guttenberg and prints out the link the crawler wants to follow and the page that link was found on. However it ignores all links that are filtered out by FILTERS and MOREFILTERS. It posts all of these results in a file titled raichu.txt.

If you are intending to run you will need to change a couple of hard coded file paths.
